        <p className="p-4 leading-7">We source our water from deep underground wells. It then goes through our 6-step quality process. This means that it meets strict standards for bottled water. And you can be sure to enjoy the same crisp, clean taste in every bottle.<br/>We add a light blend of minerals to our water to give it a pure and refreshing taste.</p>
